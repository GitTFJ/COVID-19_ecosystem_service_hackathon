To run this code, download and unzip this repository and set it as your working directory. For the code to run, you will also need a copy of the UK 2015 25metre Land Cover Map which can be accessed here: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/eab28327-9067-4d35-b916-b4ad46534c3c/land-cover-map-2015-25m-raster-gb). This should be saved in a folder named ‘lcm’ within ‘data’. The R code should be ran in order from a – g, and with modest computation power takes ~ 5 hours. Alternatively, to just see the model outputs and plots please run code beginning ‘g’.
If you have any questions please post an issue in this repository
