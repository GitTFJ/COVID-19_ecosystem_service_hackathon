This document contains supplementary figures and tables for our entry to the COVID-19 Hackathon 3: Ecosystem Services

Table S1: Variables to model against each of the two COVID-19 metrics



Figure S1: Relative change in movement over time since the baseline period (3rd Jan - 6th Feb 2020) for each of the 343 Local Authorities for 6 categories: Parks, Grocery & Pharmacy stores, Retail & Recreation, Transport, Workplace and Residential. The blue line represents the date of the first UK case and the red line is when lockdown was introduced in the UK (23rd March 2020).
