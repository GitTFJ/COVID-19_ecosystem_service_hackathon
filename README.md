# COVID-19 Hackathon 3: Ecosystem Services
## Team MeLLT
Describing how landscape structure and human behaviour change have influenced COVID-19 cases. We present a [video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WPH1QiaB-E&feature=youtu.be), as well as a [comprehensive report](https://github.com/GitTFJ/MeLLT_COVID-19_ecosystem_service_hackathon/blob/master/Report.pdf) explaining our findings and recommendations. For additional information see our [supplementary material]()


To run this code, download and unzip this repository and set it as your working directory. For the code to run, you will also need a copy of the UK 2015 25metre Land Cover Map which can be accessed here: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/eab28327-9067-4d35-b916-b4ad46534c3c/land-cover-map-2015-25m-raster-gb). This should be saved in a folder named ‘lcm’ within ‘data’. The R code should be ran in order from a – g, and with modest computation power takes ~ 5 hours. Alternatively, to just see the model outputs and plots please run code beginning ‘g’.

If you have any questions please post an issue in this repository
